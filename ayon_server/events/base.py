    ID is an automatically assigned primary identifier of the event.
    Apart from uniqueness, it does not have any special meaning. But it is used
    for dependencies and hashing.

    Hash is an unique value for an evend, which is per-topic deterministic.
    This prevents storing two identical events by two different dispatchers.
    For example 'enroll' endpoint, which is responsible to create new processing
    jobs uses hash of source event id and the target topic. that effectively
    prevents two services starting the same job.

    Depends_on is nullable field, when used, it contains an ID of previously
    finished event which this event depends.
    TBD: when a dependency is restarted, should all dependent
    events be restarted as well?
