    Fetches tasks for the Kanban board.

    Parameters
    ----------
    last : ARGLast, optional
        The number of tasks to return, by default 2000.

    before : ARGBefore, optional
        The cursor to fetch tasks before, by default None.

    projects : list[str], optional
        List of project IDs to filter tasks.
        If not specified, tasks from all projects are listed.
        For non-managers, the result is limited to projects the user has access to.
        Inactive projects are never included.

    assignees_any : list[str], optional
        List of user names to filter tasks.
        If the invoking user is a manager, tasks assigned
        to the specified users are listed.
        If not provided, all tasks are listed regardless of assignees.
        For non-managers, this is always set to [user.name].

    task_ids : list[str], optional
        If set, return explicit tasks by their IDs.
        This is used for fetching updates when a entity.task.* event is received.

    Returns
    -------
    KanbanConnection
        A connection object containing the fetched tasks.
